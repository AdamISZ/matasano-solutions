# matasano-solutions

My solutions for the cryptopals/matasano challenges in Python, see www.cryptopals.com.

Sets 1-6 finished (all challenges up to 48, except for a couple that don't need code).

Included a slowaes.py AES implementation (with padding corrected)

Shouldn't be any external dependencies (e.g. no OpenSSL), except for Crypto.RSA in a couple of later challenges, which is only used to generate primes, not to do RSA.

There are a few detailed comments, especially on the ones that I found to be hard (not necessarily the ones they say are hard!)

Nothing fancy here, just each challenge is one file, some code reuse so if you want to run any of them just grab them all.

I'm pretty much finished; there is a set 7 which I may look at in future.

As far as I remember they all work.
