    The code for this attack is in matasano36.py.
    Simply run it and enter one of the 3 cheat 
    passwords.
    About this attack: it isn't exactly some
    cryptographic marvel; the RFC (2945) explicitly (using the MUST
    keyword) forbids allowing A=0 mod N. Just an example of
    the #yolo attitude to RFCs presumably.
